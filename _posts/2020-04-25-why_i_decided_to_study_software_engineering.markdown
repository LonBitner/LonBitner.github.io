To start, my name is Lon Bitner. My wife and I have one son and another boy coming in June! I couldn't be more excited for this stage of my life. We live in the Dayton area currently. At the moment I work for Montgomery County in the Environmental Services divison. More specifically I am a wastewater treatment plant operator. This means that anything coming to the plant via the sanitary sewer is treated to Ohio EPA standards, and I help make sure that those standards are being met and maintained.

I decided to study Software Engineering to either improve my current work situation or possibly move to something completely new. For now my goal is to enter some sort of SCADA programming field for any kind of wastewater, water field or both. The SCADA system is a complete overview of whatever facility it is installed in. Now that I am actually learning coding I'm sure there are other areas I will like better. The great thing is that this is still the begining of the journey and there is still a lot to experience.
